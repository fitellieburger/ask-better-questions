# Ask Better Questions

A media-literacy tool that helps readers understand how a piece of writing works — not whether it is right or wrong.

- Surfaces three guided prompts: Words, Proof, Missing
- Separates rhetorical heat from grounding
- Focuses on writing choices, not moral judgment

This is an early public MVP.
